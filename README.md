# Website Homepage for Marketing Company



## Overview
My target was to design a page for a marketing agency. I tried to make it trendy but still easy to scroll for user.

### The challenge
At first I designed this in figma and then I started the coding. Sometimes I felt some challenge in making the page responsive because I wanted to make it responsive using as few media queries as I could use. Also there is a tiny bit of javascript I used to make it responsive and user friendly.
